# /afx-next

The "Golden Thread" command. intelligently analyzes your current context (git state, active tasks, session history) and tells you exactly what to do next.

## Configuration

**Read config** using two-tier resolution: `.afx/.afx.yaml` (managed defaults) + `.afx.yaml` (user overrides).

- `paths.specs` - Where spec files live (default: `docs/specs`)
- `paths.adr` - Where global ADR files live (default: `docs/adr`)

If neither file exists, use defaults.

## Usage

```bash
/afx-next
```

## Execution Contract (STRICT)

### Allowed

- Read/list/search files anywhere in workspace
- Analyze git state, active tasks, and session history

### Forbidden

- Create/modify/delete any files
- Run build/test/deploy/migration commands

If implementation is requested, respond with:

```text
Out of scope for /afx-next (read-only advisor mode). Use the suggested command to proceed.
```

### Timestamp Format (MANDATORY)

When writing execution reports or creating journal entries, all timestamps MUST use ISO 8601 with millisecond precision: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ` (e.g., `2025-12-17T14:30:00.000Z`). Never write short formats like `2025-12-17 14:30`. **To get the current timestamp**, run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z"` via the Bash tool — do NOT guess or use midnight (`T00:00:00.000Z`).

## Post-Action Checklist (MANDATORY)

Since this is a read-only advisor skill, no files are modified. However, after executing, you MUST:

1. Strictly follow the Analysis Logic to provide context-aware command suggestions.

### Proactive Journal Capture

When this skill detects a high-impact context switch or critical gap, auto-capture to `journal.md` per the [Proactive Capture Protocol](../afx-session/SKILL.md#proactive-capture-protocol-mandatory).

**Triggers for `/afx-next`**: Major context loss detected, multiple incomplete tasks found.

## Agent Instructions

### Context Resolution (CLI & IDE)

1. **Environment detection:** Check if IDE context is available (`ide_opened_file` or `ide_selection` tags in conversation).
2. **Feature inference:**
   - **IDE:** Infer feature from the active file path (e.g., `docs/specs/user-auth/tasks.md` → `user-auth`). If code is selected, use it as additional input context for the analysis.
   - **CLI:** Infer from explicit arguments first, then cwd or branch name (`feat/user-auth` → `user-auth`), then conversation history.
   - **Fallback:** Analyse all features if no context can be inferred — `/afx-next` is valid without a feature scope.
3. **Trailing parameters (`[...context]`):** Treat extra words as focus constraints (e.g., `/afx-next user-auth` scopes the analysis to that feature only).

### Analysis Logic

You must perform a deep context scan to determine the user's state. Follow this priority logic:

1.  **Check Plan Mode / Gates**:
    - Is `<system-reminder>Plan mode is active</system-reminder>` present?
      - **Suggestion**: "Continue planning. Edit the plan or request review."
    - Is a task waiting for review?
      - **Suggestion**: `/afx-task complete <task> "note"` (if you are the reviewer) or "Wait for human review."

2.  **Check Global ADRs** (`ls docs/adr/*.md`):
    - Are there ADRs with `status: Proposed`?
      - **Situation**: Architectural decisions are pending review.
      - **Suggestion**: "Review Proposed ADR: docs/adr/ADR-NNNN-\*.md"

3.  **Check Git State** (`git status --short`):
    - Are there uncommitted changes?
      - **Situation**: Work is in progress but not saved/verified.
      - **Suggestion**:
        1.  If strictly code changes: `/afx-check path <path>` (Verify it works)
        2.  If ready to commit: `/afx-task code` (Completing the subtask)
        3.  If just exploring: `/afx-session note "findings"` (Capture thought)

4.  **Check Active Task** (`/afx-next` logic):
    - Is there an active task in `journal.md` or GitHub?
      - **Situation**: Task is assigned but git is clean.
      - **Suggestion**: `/afx-task code` (Start/Resume implementation)

5.  **Check recent completion**:
    - Did the last session end with "Completed"?
      - **Situation**: Task done, need verification.
      - **Suggestion**: `/afx-task verify <task-id>` (Verify against spec)

6.  **Check Idle State**:
    - No active task, clean git state.
      - **Situation**: Ready for new work.
      - **Suggestion**: `/afx-task pick <spec>` (Pick up next task)

7.  **Fallbacks**:
    - Confused?
      - **Suggestion**: `/afx-help guides` (Browse workflows) or `/afx-next` (Re-orient)

### Output Format

```markdown
## Context: {Brief State Description}

**Detected**: {Uncommitted changes | Active Task X.Y | Idle | Review Pending}

Next (ranked):

1. /afx-command <args> # Context-driven: {why this is best}
2. /afx-alt1 # Context-driven: {reason}
3. /afx-alt2 # Context-driven: {reason}
   ──
4. /afx-next # Re-orient
5. /afx-session note "<note>" # Capture context
```

## Examples

**Scenario 1: Mid-Implementation**
(User has modified files but hasn't run checks)

```markdown
## Context: Implementation in Progress

**Detected**: 3 uncommitted files (modified), Task 7.4 Active

Next (ranked):

2. /afx-task code "continue" # Context-driven: Continue writing code
3. /afx-dev test claims # Context-driven: Run tests before commit
   ──
4. /afx-next # Re-orient
5. /afx-session note "context" # Capture before switching
```

**Scenario 2: Task Done**
(User just finished coding, git is clean/committed)

```markdown
## Context: Implementation Complete?

**Detected**: Git Clean, Task 7.4 marked "Done" in last session log.

Next (ranked):

1. /afx-task verify 7.4 # Context-driven: Validate against spec
2. /afx-task complete 7.4 "done" # Context-driven: Mark task complete
3. /afx-task pick docs/specs/{feature} # Context-driven: Move to next task
   ──
4. /afx-next # Re-orient
5. /afx-session note "<note>" # Capture learnings
```

**Scenario 3: Proposed ADRs**
(User created an ADR but hasn't finalized it)

```markdown
## Context: Architectural Decision Pending

**Detected**: 1 Proposed ADR (docs/adr/ADR-0001-database-choice.md)

Next (ranked):
